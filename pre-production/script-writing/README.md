# Script Writing



This channel is for turning the ideas voted on and adopted in the story-creation channel into a working script. We use the Snowflake method as an approach to writing. The snowflake method encourages starting with the simplest premise possible, from there we systematically expand it to include a plot and character details.  The below image will give you a better idea on how that's done.
